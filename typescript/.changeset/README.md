# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Usage

### Adding a changeset

When you make changes that should be released, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the bump type (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

### Releasing

To create a release:

```bash
pnpm changeset version
```

This will:
- Consume all changesets
- Update package versions
- Update CHANGELOG.md files

Then commit and push the changes, and the CI will publish to npm.
