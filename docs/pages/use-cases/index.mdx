# Use Cases

T402 enables a wide variety of payment scenarios across web services, AI agents, and digital content. The protocol's HTTP-native design makes it simple to add payments to any application.

## Use Case Categories

| Use Case | Description | Typical Pricing |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| [AI Agent Payments](/use-cases/ai-payments) | Enable AI agents to pay for APIs and services autonomously | $0.001 - $0.10 per call |
| [API Monetization](/use-cases/api-monetization) | Charge per-request fees for your API endpoints | $0.01 - $1.00 per request |
| [Premium Content](/use-cases/content-access) | Gate content behind micro-payments | $0.10 - $10.00 per item |
| [Micro-Payments](/use-cases/micro-payments) | Enable sub-cent payments for any digital resource | $0.0001 - $0.01 per tx |

## AI Agent Payments

AI agents need a way to pay for services programmatically. T402 enables autonomous payments through:

- **MCP Integration**: Claude, GPT, and other AI agents can pay via the Model Context Protocol
- **No human intervention**: Agents sign and submit payments automatically
- **Budget controls**: Set spending limits and approval workflows

**Typical pricing:** $0.001 - $0.10 per API call

## API Monetization

Turn any API endpoint into a paid service with a single line of middleware:

- **Per-request pricing**: Charge exactly what each request is worth
- **No subscriptions needed**: Users pay only for what they use
- **Global payments**: Accept USDT/USDC from anywhere in the world

**Typical pricing:** $0.01 - $1.00 per request

## Premium Content Access

Gate articles, media, or downloadable content without subscription fatigue:

- **Micro-transactions**: Charge $0.10 for an article instead of $10/month
- **No account required**: Pay with any supported wallet
- **Instant access**: Content unlocks immediately after payment

**Typical pricing:** $0.10 - $10.00 per item

## Micro-Payments

Enable payments as small as fractions of a cent for IoT, data, and compute:

- **Sub-cent transactions**: Pay $0.0001 for a single data point
- **Gasless payments**: ERC-4337 enables zero-gas transactions
- **High throughput**: Process thousands of payments per second

**Typical pricing:** $0.0001 - $0.01 per transaction

## Why T402?

| Traditional Payments | T402 |
|---------------------|------|
| Credit card fees (2.9% + $0.30) | Near-zero fees on L2s (~$0.001) |
| KYC/identity verification | Wallet-based, pseudonymous |
| Chargebacks possible | Irreversible settlements |
| Complex integration | Single HTTP header |
| Subscription-only models | Pay-per-use enabled |
| Days to receive funds | Instant settlement |

## Network Recommendations

| Use Case | Recommended Network | Why |
|----------|---------------------|-----|
| AI API calls | Base, Arbitrum | Low fees, fast finality |
| Premium APIs | Base, Ethereum | Wide wallet support |
| Content access | TON, TRON | Large user base in specific regions |
| Micro-payments | Base (gasless) | ERC-4337 for zero-gas UX |
| High-value transactions | Ethereum | Maximum security |
| Cross-chain | Any USDT0 chain | LayerZero bridging |

## Implementation Complexity

| Scenario | Effort | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Add payments to existing API | Low | Add middleware, configure routes |
| Build new paid service | Low | Use SDK from scratch |
| Gasless payments | Medium | Set up ERC-4337 infrastructure |
| Cross-chain support | Medium | Configure multiple networks |
| Custom facilitator | High | Deploy and operate facilitator |
